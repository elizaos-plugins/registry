Contributing to ElizaOS Plugin Registry 🚀
Welcome to the ElizaOS Plugin Registry - the epicenter of autonomous agent innovation! This registry powers 183+ official plugins and serves as the gateway for developers worldwide to contribute to the future of AI agents.
🎯 Mission Statement
The ElizaOS Plugin Registry is where cutting-edge AI agent capabilities are born, tested, and distributed to the global community. Every plugin here represents a step toward more capable, versatile, and powerful autonomous agents.
🔥 What Makes a Registry-Worthy Plugin
Your plugin isn't just code - it's a contribution to the AI agent revolution. To earn a spot in this registry, your plugin must be:

🛡️ Production-Ready: Robust error handling, comprehensive testing, and bulletproof security
⚡ Performance-Optimized: Efficient, scalable, and won't slow down agent operations
📚 Exceptionally Documented: Clear examples, comprehensive API docs, and troubleshooting guides
🎨 Professionally Branded: Quality visual assets that represent your plugin's capabilities
🧪 Thoroughly Tested: Comprehensive test coverage with both unit and integration tests

🚀 Quick Start: Adding Your Plugin
Ready to join the elite? Here's your path to registry inclusion:
Step 1: Develop Your Plugin
Use our battle-tested development approaches:
Option A: ElizaOS CLI (Recommended for New Devs)
bash# Get the tools of the trade
npm install -g elizaos

# Create your masterpiece
elizaos create my-revolutionary-plugin
cd my-revolutionary-plugin

# Start building with hot reloading
elizaos dev
Option B: Plugin Starter Template (For the Experienced)
bash# Clone the proven foundation
git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza-plugin-starter.git
cd eliza-plugin-starter

# Configure and build
cp .env.example .env
bun install && bun build

# Launch development
pnpm start
Option C: Full Repository Development (For the Hardcore)
bash# Get the complete ElizaOS source
git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git
cd eliza

# Lock to stable release
git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)

# Setup and build
cp .env.example .env
pnpm install --include=optional sharp
pnpm build && pnpm start
Step 2: Follow the Sacred Architecture
Every registry plugin must implement the core interface:
typescriptinterface Plugin {
    name: string;                    // Your plugin's unique identity
    description: string;             // What makes it special
    actions?: Action[];              // The magic it performs
    providers?: Provider[];          // Context it provides
    evaluators?: Evaluator[];        // How it judges behavior
    services?: Service[];            // Platform integrations
    clients?: Client[];              // Platform connections
    adapters?: Adapter[];            // Data transformation
    init?: (config, runtime) => Promise<void>; // Initialization ritual
}
Step 3: Structure Like a Pro
Your plugin repository must follow our battle-tested structure:
your-plugin/
├── images/                        # 🎨 Visual branding assets
│   ├── logo.png                   # Square logo (400x400px)

└── README.md                      # 📖 Your plugin's story
💎 Registry Standards
Package Configuration Perfection
Your package.json must include our registry metadata:
json{
    "name": "@elizaos/plugin-revolutionary",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "type": "module",
    "main": "dist/index.js",
    "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
    "agentConfig": {
        "pluginType": "elizaos:plugin:1.0.0",
        "pluginParameters": {
            "API_KEY": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Your secret weapon API key"
            }
        }
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "@elizaos/core": "^1.0.0"
    },
    "scripts": {
        "build": "tsc && cp -R src/plugins dist/plugins",
        "test": "jest",
        "lint": "eslint src --ext .ts",
        "format": "prettier --write src"
    }
}
Action Implementation Excellence
Actions are where your plugin shines. Make them count:
typescriptimport { Action, HandlerCallback, IAgentRuntime, Memory, State } from '@elizaos/core';

export const revolutionaryAction: Action = {
    name: "REVOLUTIONARY_TASK",
    similes: ["AMAZING_TASK", "INCREDIBLE_FEAT"],
    description: "Performs revolutionary AI agent task",
    
    validate: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory) => {
        // Bulletproof validation
        return true;
    },
    
    handler: async (
        runtime: IAgentRuntime,
        message: Memory,
        state: State,
        options: { [key: string]: unknown },
        callback?: HandlerCallback
    ): Promise<boolean> => {
        try {
            // Your revolutionary implementation here
            await callback({
                text: "Revolutionary task completed flawlessly!",
                content: { success: true, revolution: "accomplished" }
            });
            return true;
        } catch (error) {
            await callback({
                text: `Revolution temporarily delayed: ${error.message}`,
                content: { success: false, error: error.message }
            });
            return false;
        }
    },
    
    examples: [
        [
            {
                user: "user",
                content: { text: "Start the revolution!" }
            },
            {
                user: "assistant", 
                content: { text: "Revolutionary task initiated! 🚀" }
            }
        ]
    ]
};
Provider Power
Providers fuel your agent's intelligence:
typescriptimport { Provider, IAgentRuntime, Memory } from '@elizaos/core';

export const intelligenceProvider: Provider = {
    get: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime, message: Memory) => {
        try {
            const insights = await gatherIntelligence(runtime);
            return `Current intelligence level: ${insights.level} | Capabilities: ${insights.capabilities.join(', ')}`;
        } catch (error) {
            return `Intelligence gathering failed: ${error.message}`;
        }
    },
};
🧪 Testing Like a Champion
Your plugin must pass our rigorous testing standards:
typescriptimport { describe, it, expect, beforeEach } from '@jest/globals';
import { runAiTest } from "@elizaos/core/test_resources";
import revolutionaryPlugin from '../src/index';

describe('Revolutionary Plugin', () => {
    beforeEach(() => {
        // Setup your testing environment
    });

    it('should revolutionize the AI agent world', async () => {
        const result = await runAiTest({
            messages: [{ 
                user: "user1", 
                content: { text: "Start the revolution!" } 
            }],
            expected: "revolutionary confirmation",
        });
        expect(result.success).toBe(true);
        expect(result.revolution).toBe("accomplished");
    });

    it('should handle edge cases like a pro', async () => {
        // Test edge cases, error conditions, and boundary scenarios
    });
});
